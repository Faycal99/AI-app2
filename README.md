# Breast Cancer Classification (Benign vs. Malignant)

This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to predict whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

The dataset contains 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of fine-needle aspirates of breast masses. These features describe the size, shape, and texture of cell nuclei, such as:

radius_mean – average cell radius

texture_mean – variation in gray-scale values

perimeter_mean – average perimeter length

area_mean – average cell area

smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, etc.

Plus corresponding standard error (SE) and worst-case values for each feature.

The target variable is:

M = Malignant (cancerous)

B = Benign (non-cancerous)

The application trains a machine learning model on these features to automatically classify tumors, providing a step toward AI-assisted medical diagnosis.
